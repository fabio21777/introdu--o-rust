1 - On the page at https://rootfinance.xyz/, the "Launch Dapp" button is almost transparent, and the font weight is very low, making it hard to access. Suggested improvement: highlight the "Launch App" button and increase the font weight. Here is a screenshot with the suggestion:

2 - The GitHub link leads to a 404 page.

3 - Similarly, if it is not possible to repay, the button should be disabled.

If I have repaid the loan, I expect the buttons to be disabled or to show some status indicating that the loan has already been paid.

If there is no liquidity, it might be better to disable the option and leave a notice for the user:

There is an error when trying to borrow XUSDT, which I believe is related to liquidity. If this is the case, it would be wise to block the borrowing action.

A suggestion for the listing: only display assets that have debts, removing those that have been paid off.

4 - I miss having a history page of my transactions on the site, showing when I paid and when I borrowed.
